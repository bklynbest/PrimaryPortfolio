					<p> I'm a Web Developer based in Brooklyn, New York. My area of expertise is Ruby on Rails, 
					    and I also enjoy working with front-end technologies like JavaScript and CSS. I have 
					    been interested in technology and gaming since I was just a kid.

          <p> In my early teens, I enjoyed designing my own MySpace page and fell in love with computers. 
             I spent countless hours on Xbox Live, where I went by the name Britannia online. I continue
             to use it today because the nostalgia that it brings back serves as a reminder of my true interests 
             and motivates me to keep moving forward toward my ultimate goals. My path to becoming a web developer
             has been winding.
          </p>

            I studied in a Pharmacy program at Long Island University and worked in healthcare for several years. 
            I’ve learned to manage stress and work through difficult situations with a calm head. This rewarding 
            work makes me a well-rounded developer and I like using my skills to improve the world. I’m currently 
            working with CodeDoesGood, a non-profit committed to using the tech community to build solutions to real
            world problems, where I am helping build their frontend. I’m looking for freelance or full-time web development 
            work in the NYC area. Check out some of my work here, and contact me if you would like to chat about working together.
